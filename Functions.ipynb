        "ANS) Generators in Python are a special type of iterator, defined using functions rather than classes. They allow you to iterate over a sequence of values\n",

        "\n",
        "a) Generator Function:\n",
        "A generator function is defined like a regular function but uses the yield keyword instead of return to produce a value.\n",
        "When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over. The function’s code is not executed immediately but only when the generator's __next__() method is called.\n",
        "\n",

        "The yield statement is used to produce a value and pause the function's execution, saving its state (local variables, the position in the code, etc.) so it can resume where it left off when next() is called again.\n",

        "c) Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "Generators compute values on the fly and yield them one at a time, making them memory-efficient.\n",

        "a) Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Advantage: Generators produce items one at a time and do not require storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "b)  Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "Advantage: Generators evaluate items only when needed. They don’t compute values in advance, which can save computational resources.\n",

        "\n",
        "c) Infinite Sequences\n",
        "Advantage: Generators can produce an infinite sequence of values because they don’t need to store all values at once.\n",

        "\n",
        "d) Improved Performance\n",
        "Advantage: By yielding values one at a time, generators can reduce the initial computation time and handle data more efficiently.\n",
        "Benefit: This can lead to improved performance, especially in scenarios where only a portion of the data is needed at any given time.\n",
        "\n",
        "e)  Readable and Maintainable Code\n",
        "Advantage: Generators can simplify code by abstracting the iteration logic into a compact and readable form.\n",

        "f) Pipelining\n",
